## Introduction

Oni is a new kind of editor, focused on maximizing productivity - combining _modal editing_ with features you expect in modern editors. Oni is built with [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), and inspired by [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/), and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

The vision of Oni is to build an editor that allows you to go from _thought to code_ as easily as possible - bringing together the raw editing power of Vim, the feature capabilities of Atom/VSCode, and a powerful and intuitive extensibility model - wrapped up in a beautiful package.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide both the full-fledged Vim experience, with no compromises, while pushing forward to enable new productivity scenarios.

- __Modern UX__ - The Vim experience should not be compromised by terminal limitations.
- __Rich plugin development__ - using JavaScript, instead of VimL.
- __Cross-platform support__ - across Windows, OS X, and Linux.
- __Batteries included__ - rich features are available out of the box - minimal setup needed to be productive.
- __Performance__ - no compromises, Vim is fast, and Oni should be fast too.
- __Ease Learning Curve__ - without sacrificing the Vim experience.

Vim is an incredible tool for manipulating *text* at the speed of thought. With a composable, modal command language, it is no wonder that Vim usage is still prevalent today.

However, going from thought to *code* has some different challenges than going from thought to *text*. Code editors today provide several benefits that help to reduce __cognitive load__ when writing code, and that benefit is tremendously important - not only in terms of pure coding efficiency and productivity, but also in making the process of writing code enjoyable and fun.

The goal of this project is to give an editor that gives the best of both worlds - the power, speed, and flexibility of using Vim for manipulating text, as well as the rich tooling that comes with an IDE. We want to make coding as efficient, fast, and fun as we can!
